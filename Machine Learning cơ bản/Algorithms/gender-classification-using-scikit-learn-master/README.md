# gender-classification-using-scikit-learn

##Siraj Raval's Challenge

Find 3 more classifiers from the sci-kit learn documentation and add them to the demo.py code. Train them on the same dataset and compare their results. You can determine accuracy by trying to predict testing you trained classifier on samples from the training data and see if it correctly classifies it. Push your code repository to github then post it in the comments.

This is the code for the gender classification challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #1' by @Sirajology on YouTube.
The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree,K nearest neighbors, SVM, Naive_bayes on a small dataset of body metrics 
(height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. 
Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.
I have compared all the models for their accuracy using the accuracy_score()
You can use your own data to train and predict the values.
